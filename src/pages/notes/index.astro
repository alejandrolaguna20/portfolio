      I'm a second year computer science student at the European Institute of Technology, still trying to figure out my place but enjoying the journey through systems programming, webdev and other fields. Outside of code, my favorite writer is Isaac Asimov, my favorite piece of music is Spiegel im Spiegel, and my favorite book is The Witches by Roald Dahl. My favorite star is Vega because it was once our north star and will be again in about 12,000 years - something poetic about that cycle. And that's pretty much everything you need to know about me, except maybe my tea preferences, but we'll save that for another time...    </p>
